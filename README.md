## ðŸŒŸ What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard developed by Anthropic that provides a universal protocol for connecting AI assistants and Large Language Models (LLMs) to external data sources, tools, and systems. Think of it as the "USB-C for AI Applications" - a standardized way to connect AI models with the data and tools they need.
