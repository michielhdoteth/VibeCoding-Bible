# Introduction to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to standardize communication between AI applications and external services like tools, databases, and templates. Introduced by Anthropic in November 2024, it aims to enable frontier models to generate more relevant and improved responses. The protocol has since been adopted by major AI providers such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind.

MCP addresses the challenge of connecting AI systems with various data sources, which previously required custom integrations for each source. It provides a universal interface for tasks like reading files, executing functions, and managing contextual prompts. The protocol is built on the concept of MCP clients and servers. The client, existing within a host application, structures user requests for the protocol to process, while the server exposes data through resources.

## Key components of the Model Context Protocol include:
*   A formal protocol specification and software development kits (SDKs).
*   Support for local MCP servers in applications like the Claude Desktop apps.
*   An open-source repository of MCP server implementations, such as Context7, which provides up-to-date code documentation to LLMs and AI coding assistants.

MCP is designed to be versatile, allowing connections to both internal and external resources and tools. It draws inspiration from the message-flow ideas of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and is transported over JSON-RPC 2.0. The protocol has applications in software development, business process automation, and natural language automation.
