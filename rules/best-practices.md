Effective communication with your AI assistant is the cornerstone of Vibe Coding. The quality of your prompts directly correlates with the quality of the AI's output. Mastering prompt engineering is crucial for guiding the AI towards accurate, relevant, and useful code.

### 1. Be Specific and Provide Context: Precision is Power

*   **Elaboration:** Vague or ambiguous prompts lead to generic or incorrect AI responses. Always strive for utmost clarity. Define the exact programming language, version, frameworks, and libraries you are using. Clearly state the desired functionality, expected inputs, and required outputs. Specify any performance, security, or stylistic constraints.
*   **Actionable Advice:**
    *   **Define Scope:** Clearly delineate what the AI should and should not do.
    *   **Input/Output Specification:** Provide examples of input data and the exact format of the desired output.
    *   **Technical Environment:** Explicitly state your tech stack (e.g., "Python 3.10, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy," "TypeScript, React 18, Tailwind CSS").
    *   **Existing Code:** When modifying or extending existing code, always provide the relevant code snippets for context.
*   **Why it Matters:** Reduces ambiguity, minimizes iterations, and ensures the AI generates code that fits your project's specific needs.

### 2. Break Down Complex Tasks: Divide and Conquer

*   **Elaboration:** Large, monolithic prompts overwhelm LLMs and often result in incomplete or erroneous outputs. Decompose complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Guide the AI through each step sequentially.
*   **Actionable Advice:**
    *   **Modular Prompting:** Use the techniques described in `prompting/prompt-engineering.md` to structure your requests into distinct modules (e.g., Persona, Task, Constraints, Examples).
    *   **Iterative Development:** Tackle one sub-problem at a time. Once a part is satisfactory, move to the next, building upon the previous AI-generated code.
    *   **Chain-of-Thought:** Encourage the AI to reason step-by-step by including phrases like "Let's think step by step" or "First, do X, then Y, then Z."
*   **Why it Matters:** Improves accuracy, makes debugging easier, and allows the AI to focus its computational resources on smaller, more defined problems.

### 3. Include Examples and Constraints: Show, Don't Just Tell

*   **Elaboration:** Examples are powerful teaching tools for AI. They demonstrate your intent more effectively than abstract descriptions. Constraints guide the AI towards desired patterns and away from undesirable ones.
*   **Actionable Advice:**
    *   **Few-shot Learning:** Provide 1-3 (or more, if context window allows) input-output examples to illustrate the desired behavior or format.
    *   **Code Snippets:** Show examples of your preferred coding style, design patterns, or specific API usage.
    *   **Negative Constraints:** Explicitly state what the AI should *not* do (e.g., "Do not use global variables," "Avoid recursion for this problem").
    *   **Format Constraints:** Specify output formats like JSON, XML, Markdown, or specific code structures.
*   **Why it Matters:** Enhances the AI's understanding of nuances, ensures adherence to specific formats, and helps enforce coding standards.
